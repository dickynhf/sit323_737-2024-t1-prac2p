# Express Server

This project, Express Server, is a simple web server built with Node.js and the Express framework. It's designed to serve HTML content and is a foundational step towards more complex web development projects. This README provides a guide on how to set up, configure, and run the Express Server.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you meet the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
- You are using a Windows, Linux, or Mac machine.
- Optional: Familiarity with [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) can be helpful.

## Installing Express Server

To get Express Server up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the Express Server repository to your local machine using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/dickynhf/sit323_737-2024-t1-prac2p.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary project dependencies by running:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Project

Follow these steps to start the Express Server:

1. **Start the Server**: In the root directory of the project, run the following command:

    ```sh
    node server.js
    ```

    This will start the Express server on a predefined port (commonly port 3000).

2. **Access the Server**: Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3300](http://localhost:3300). You should see the HTML content served by the Express Server.

## Using Express Server

Explain how users can utilize your project, including any available endpoints, parameters, or interactive features. This section should provide clear instructions on how the server can be used once it's running.
